#The project is basicly showing famous crypto currencies chart and basic information and calculating ema and sma
At first we need to install some external libraries like streamlit and plotly.graph_objs
We make the page and have a list of crypto currencies than we add coins list and day switching bar for us to choose one of them
After that we have a basic function that calculates sma and ema for us
Than we select the coins using for loop and downloading there price information using yaho finance library
Than we show basic information in a table like high price open price volume and so
And at last we plot all these together and show them for our project
Remember that you should run the file using CMD and streamlit run filename.py
